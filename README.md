A WinForms application for a simple to use YouTube downloader as well as a file format converter!

# Dependencies 
Put the executable in a folder of it's own, as it downloads [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) and [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) executables automatically and needs them in the current working directory.
*Please note, depending on your internet connection it might take a while to download both!
